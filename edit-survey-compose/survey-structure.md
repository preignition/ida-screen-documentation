# Survey Structure 
 This field shows the structure of the survey.  A survey is composed of the following building blocks:  
-  **Page**  *I am not clear on how pages work.  Does a survey ever have more than 1 page? Discuss with Christophe*
- **Section**  Sections can be used to break a survey down into separate parts or sections.  
- **Questions**  The individual questions that make up a survey
