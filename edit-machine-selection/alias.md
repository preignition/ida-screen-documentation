# Aliases 
Each selection process has its own unique link which applicants can use to apply for the program.  
- These are automatically generated and are difficult to read or remember 
- Therefore aliases can be created to provide an easier, more memorable link
- To add an alias, simply enter in the 'alias' field.  Aliases can also be removed here
- All the aliases that are available for the program will be shown under the heading 'Other available links for applying to this selection process'
