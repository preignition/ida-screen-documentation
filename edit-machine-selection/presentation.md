When applicants click on a link to apply for a member, they are taken to a landing page which is unique to that member.
- This is where your unique landing page can be created and edited
- Provide sufficient information both about the member itself and the selection process
- Your logo can be added using markdown.  Please email help@preignition.org if you need help doing this.
- The landing page can be presented in any of the languages you have set for the member.  See 'settings' for details for how to do this.
