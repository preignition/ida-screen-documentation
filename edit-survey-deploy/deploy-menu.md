# Notifications 
 This is where you can create and edit notifications which are linked to a survey.  
- Notifications can be shared with applicants via their bulletin board and via email.
- Notifications can be sent to invite an applicant to fill in a survey or to communicate with them once their survey has been submitted.  

It is currently not possible to create a new notification directly from this page.  Create a new notification under Resources> Notifications and then you can select it here.
